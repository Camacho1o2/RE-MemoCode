- through this memory game application, beginners can apply what they've learned, allowing them to actively use that experience for coding and building their foundation on that knowledge.
 3. Engaging and Interactive Learning:
- by making the learning process enjoyable for beginners, the gamified nature of the tutorial keeps the learner motivated and focused, encouraging them to explore more concepts of coding and solving problems creatively without feeling intimidated by it.
 
4. Step-by-step Guidance:
- this contains a step-by-step tutorial guidance and structured learning activities, guiding beginners through the development process from start to finish like explanations for
the code snippet, code samples, and exercises that will help learners/players to understand each programming concept.
 
5. Reinforce of Learning Objectives:
- The memory game tutorial enhances learning objectives by incorporating coding challenges and interactive activities, enhancing learner’s comprehension of programming principles and techniques.

6. Practical Application of Skills:
- building a memory game will provide a practical application of programming skills and learners gain hands-on experience on coding including its implementation, testing, and debugging.
 
7. Transferable Skill Development:
- skills acquired during playing this memory game are transferable to other programming projects and domains as to why beginners can develop problem-solving skills, logical reasoning and algorithm thinking that are valuable across various industries and different specialized areas or fields within the broad domain of computer-related fields.
 

8. Preparation for Advance Topics:
- for learners/players who want to explore programming concepts to study in advance for any computer-related courses, as programming now has many areas and fields. This will inspire the player/learner on coding and this mobile game application will serve as a stepping stone for those who want to learn and adapt programming concepts.
